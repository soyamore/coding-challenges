## Even Fibonacci numbers
### Problem
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solution
```
const getSumOfEvenFibonacciNumbers = (limit) => {
  if (limit) {
    let current = 2, prev = 1, next, sum = 0;
    do {
        next = current + prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
        sum += prev % 2 === 0 ? prev : 0;
    } while (prev < limit);
    return sum;
  }
  return 0;
}
console.log(getSumOfEvenFibonacciNumbers(4000000)) // Should return 4613732
```
